This analysis leverages SQLAlchemy and Pandas to explore weather data from a SQLite database, focusing on precipitation and temperature metrics recorded across various weather stations in Hawaii.

Part two of the project implements a Flask-based API that provides access to weather data from a SQLite database containing historical climate data from Hawaii. The API allows users to retrieve information such as precipitation, weather station details, and temperature observations for specific date ranges.
